  <h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I hail from <strong>Barrackpore</strong> in West Bengal, which has great historical significance.</p>

<p>I was born on <strong>15th April</strong>, which is celebrated as <em>Pahela Baisakh</em> in West Bengal — the Bengali New Year — and marked with great pomp and show in many Indian states.</p>

<p>After completing my schooling in Barrackpore, I pursued my <strong>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</strong> from <strong>St. Xavier's College, Kolkata</strong>, followed by a <strong>Master of Science in Mathematics</strong> from the <strong>University of Calcutta</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>2015</strong>, I was awarded the <strong>Research Award in Mathematics</strong> by the <em>National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM)</em>. I also secured the <strong>Junior Research Fellowship</strong> from the <em>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</em>.</p>

<p>I completed my <strong>Ph.D. in Algebraic Graph Theory</strong> from the <em>Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Calcutta</em> in <strong>2022</strong>. During my doctoral research, I published <strong>16 research papers</strong>, of which <strong>12 are single-authored</strong>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as an <strong>Assistant Professor</strong> in the <strong>Department of Mathematics, JIS University</strong>. Recently, I received the prestigious <strong>JIS Samman Award</strong> for the highest number of publications in an academic year.</p>

<p>My research interests include <strong>Combinatorics</strong>, <strong>Matrix Theory</strong>, and <strong>Algebraic Graph Theory</strong>.</p>
