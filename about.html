    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">I hail from <strong class="text-gray-900">Barrackpore</strong> in West Bengal, which has great historical significance.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">I was born on <strong class="text-gray-900">15th April</strong>, which is celebrated as <em class="text-gray-600">Pahela Baisakh</em> in West Bengal — the Bengali New Year — and marked with great pomp and show in many Indian states.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">After completing my schooling in Barrackpore, I pursued my <strong class="text-gray-900">Bachelor of Science in Mathematics</strong> from <strong class="text-gray-900">St. Xavier's College, Kolkata</strong>, followed by a <strong class="text-gray-900">Master of Science in Mathematics</strong> from the <strong class="text-gray-900">University of Calcutta</strong>.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">In <strong class="text-gray-900">2015</strong>, I was awarded the <strong class="text-gray-900">Research Award in Mathematics</strong> by the <em class="text-gray-600">National Board for Higher Mathematics (NBHM)</em>. I also secured the <strong class="text-gray-900">Junior Research Fellowship</strong> from the <em class="text-gray-600">Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR)</em>.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">I completed my <strong class="text-gray-900">Ph.D. in Algebraic Graph Theory</strong> from the <em class="text-gray-600">Department of Pure Mathematics, University of Calcutta</em> in <strong class="text-gray-900">2022</strong>. During my doctoral research, I published <strong class="text-gray-900">16 research papers</strong>, of which <strong class="text-gray-900">12 are single-authored</strong>.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Currently, I am working as an <strong class="text-gray-900">Assistant Professor</strong> in the <strong class="text-gray-900">Department of Mathematics, JIS University</strong>. Recently, I received the prestigious <strong class="text-gray-900">JIS Samman Award</strong> for the highest number of publications in an academic year.</p>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">My research interests include <strong class="text-gray-900">Combinatorics</strong>, <strong class="text-gray-900">Matrix Theory</strong>, and <strong class="text-gray-900">Algebraic Graph Theory</strong>.</p>
